            I'm a software engineer focused on creating efficient, scalable
            solutions for complex problems. With an emphasis on reducing
            technical debt and designing systems that support long-term business
            goals, I aim to deliver clean and maintainable code.
          </p>

            Being an engineer isnâ€™t just about coding and development. Its about
            understanding business requirements and solving business problems.
            In my career as a software engineer, I work in an environment that
            allows me to think and share my ideas on new features and designs
            that helps the business grow and thrive.
